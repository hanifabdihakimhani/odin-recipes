    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        After tons of trial and error, I have finally created a baked donut that isn't compromised in flavor or texture. I hope these chocolate-coffee donuts become a sweet staple to your home as they have mine! Add your favorite glaze or powdered sugar, or enjoy without anything else - they're that good!

    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> Â¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons buttermilk</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup strong brewed coffee</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup chocolate chips, or to taste (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 6-cavity donut pan with 1 teaspoon butter and set aside.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour, cocoa powder, and baking powder together in a large bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Whisk brown sugar, 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons buttermilk, coffee, egg, 1 tablespoon butter, and vanilla extract together in another bowl. Add milk mixture to flour mixture; whisk until blended and smooth. Stir in chocolate chips.
        <li>Pour batter into a large, resealable plastic bag, cut 1 corner, and squeeze batter into the prepared donut pan, filling each mold about 2/3 full.
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until donuts spring back when lightly pressed, about 8 minutes. Let cool in the pan on a wire rack for about 5 minutes; turn pan over directly onto rack to release donuts. Allow to cool for 5 minutes more.
    </ol>
